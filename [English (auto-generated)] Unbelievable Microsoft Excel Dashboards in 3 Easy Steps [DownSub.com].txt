hello and welcome to unbelievable

dashboards my name is jefff I'm glad

you're here let's just jump right in

today I'll show you how to build an

interactive Excel dashboard in three

easy steps and let's start with the

first step right now exercise one we

have a table that shows the survey data

for our net promoter score and we'd like

to make this data easier to read and

understand and today we're going to use

this single data table as our data

source if your dashboard requires more

tables no worries the same basic steps

will apply first we select any cell in

our table and then we go to insert pivot

chart pivot chart the first thing it

wants to know is where's our data range

and that's automatically selected

because we selected any cell within our

data table the next thing it wants to

know is where do we want to put the

pivot chart in this case we're going to

put it on an existing worksheet we're

going to browse over here and we're

going to pick a cell and we're going to

click okay you're going to notice

there's an underlying pivot table and a

pivot chart and basically the pivot

chart displays the values in this pivot

table and after we're done with our

pivot chart I'm just going to cover the

pivot table with our pivot chart but for

now what we want to do is we want to

view this by region so we're going to

check the region and we want to see the

score so we check score now by default

this is showing the sum of the score and

what we really want to see is the

average few different ways to do this

what we're going to do is Click sum of

score value field settings and we're

going to pick average but depending on

what you're working on you can check out

these other options and we click okay so

as you can see the pivot table does the

summary and the pivot chart displays the

values in the pivot table so these are

linked if we don't need to see the pivot

table we can just click and drag like

this now in a minute we're going to do

some formatting on this but right now we

can see the score by region what we also

want to see is the score over time so to

show that we're going to insert a line

chart we go back to our data source

insert pivot chart existing

worksheet pick a cell and click cck okay

all right I'm just going to slide this

to the right a little bit so once again

we have a pivot chart and an underlying

pivot table we want to see the trend

over time so we're going to insert date

and score now by default this is a

column chart but no worries it's easy to

change the chart type we just go to

design change chart type and here we're

going to pick line and we click okay and

once again I'm just going to position

this right here and I'm going to close

this so depending on the dashboard

you're working on you can easily add

additional charts but these two charts

are enough to demonstrate the process

now let's go to the next exercise

exercise two so the first thing we want

to do is resize these but we want to

resize them to be the same size so what

we can do is group select the charts and

then resize them together the way that

we do that is select the first chart

hold down the shift key select the next

chart now if I already just click and

drag you can see I can make this any

aspect ratio I want

I'm going to undo but if we hold down

the shift key while using this click and

drag the aspect ratio is locked in the

other thing we can do while they're both

selected is change the alignment for

example I go to shape format align top

and then I'm going to delete a couple of

these columns now let's move this one to

the left a little bit if I don't hold

any keyboard Keys down I can move this

anywhere I want and that's fine let me

undo if I hold the shift key down and

then move it now it's going to stay on

that horizontal axis

that looks better now let's apply some

formatting now to be honest I'm not an

expert in visual design but I've read

some wonderful books by Steven F who is

an expert the one I'd recommend is show

me the numbers so if you'd like to learn

more about how to design your charts

check out show me the numbers by Steven

F now the first thing we want to do is

minimize the chart junk these are all

the excess pixels that don't really

contribute to the chart for example

these buttons so I'm going to select the

chart pivot chart analyze and I'm just

going to hide all field buttons and I'll

do the same thing

here I'm also going to remove this

Legend so I'm just going to click this

and untick

Legend same with this

one while we're here I'm also going to

remove these grid lines and same with

this and by the way there are many

different chart elements to explore so

depending on what you're working on I

definitely recommend you checking these

out now let's add a descriptive title

I'm going to double click this title and

I'm going to put put net promoter score

by region and here I'm going to put net

promoter

score by month and let's close this with

our basic dashboard in place let's go to

the next exercise exercise three now

we'd like to make these charts easy to

filter and we'd like to see what happens

when we have more data let's start with

our filter these charts support a

variety of different filters including

slicers and a timeline so we select

either chart and go to Pivot chart

analyze we could use a slicer if we

wanted to filter by a category column

such as region in this case we want to

filter by date so we're going to go with

timeline we select our date field in

this case there's only one and we click

okay now if you've never played with a

timeline there's a lot of different

options so you're definitely going to

want to check out all these commands but

in summary I can click a single period

and this chart updates and in a minute

I'm going to show you how to connect

this slicer to this chart as well so we

can click any individual

period or we can click and drag to

select multiple

periods currently the period is months

but there's other options so you can

check those out now let's connect it to

this chart as well what we do is we

select the timeline and we simply click

report connections and this is basically

saying when I interact with the filter

what underlying pivot tables will be

filtered currently there's only one we

want this one as well so we check it and

click okay when we interact with the

timeline both charts are updated let's

do January to February let's do January

to March let's do January to

April now the other thing to note is

this timeline does not need to stay on

this sheet we can use a standard cut and

paste to move it for example let me cut

this and

paste now if I select it January and

February and I go to my dashboard I can

see that these charts were updated

accordingly let's go back and select

January through April head over to the

dashboard everything looks good now what

happens next period when we have new

data let's go back to the data source

and we got a new survey we got survey

1014 it happened on May 2nd 2030 for the

North Region and they got an eight how

does this new data make it into the

dashboard that's the beautiful part

let's go over to the dashboard and we

click data refresh all now those pivot

tables were refreshed with the new

survey data it's not reflected in these

charts why because of the timeline let's

head back to the timeline select January

through May and let's go back to the

dashboard and now we can see it includes

may as well also I just realized that

this is still on sum and not average so

let's fix that remember how let's select

the chart and turn on the field

list instead of sum of score we can go

to Value field settings select average

and depending on what you're working on

check out these other options and click

okay and let's close this and that looks

much better so that's how we can create

an interactive Dynamic dashboard we

start with the source data table or

tables and we create as many pivot

charts as we need each pivot chart

displays the results of a corresponding

pivot table we can also add filters in

we would use a slicer for category

column such as region and we'd use a

timeline for a date column and by the

way charts have a ton of design options

in addition to all of these chart

elements that I mentioned earlier we

have a bunch of commands in the ribbon

so depending on what you're working on

you're definitely going to want to

explore these I hope this has been

helpful thanks for joining me have a

great day hey XL user if you ever need

to create summary reports check out my

pivot table for beginers video it starts

at the beginning and shows how to store

the data transactions in a table and

then how to summarize those transactions

with a pivot table report I hope it

helps unlock the incredible power of

pivot

tables this video is a produ of excel
